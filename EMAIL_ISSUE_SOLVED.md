## 🔍 What Was The Problem?

### Issue: Resend Test Mode Restriction

Your Resend API key is in **test mode**, which means:
- ❌ You can ONLY send emails to: `suhaiby9800@gmail.com`
- ❌ You CANNOT send to other email addresses (like `asuhaib621@gmail.com`)
- ✅ This is a security feature to prevent spam during testing

### The Error Message:
```
You can only send testing emails to your own email address (suhaiby9800@gmail.com).
To send emails to other recipients, please verify a domain.
```

## ✅ Immediate Solution (For Testing)

### Use Your Verified Email:

When testing, always use: **suhaiby9800@gmail.com**

```bash
# Test email sending
npm run test-email suhaiby9800@gmail.com
